# Citari production MVP blueprint

Status: active execution, not approved for production
Owner: `zeldxh`
Target: production-ready multi-tenant booking platform  
Last evidence audit: 2026-09-03

## Execution governance

Every numbered item is an independently reviewable deliverable. An item is
complete only when its implementation, automated evidence, operational
documentation, and rollback or recovery behavior are merged into `main`.
Code existing locally, a design proposal, or a passing unit test alone does not
close an item. P0 items are release blockers; P1 items are part of the MVP
unless the go-live review records a named owner, deadline, and accepted risk.

Evidence must be durable and linked from a pull request: tests and scan reports
from CI, migration output, a runbook or ADR, and staging evidence where the
behavior depends on managed infrastructure. The final go-live review audits all
200 items one by one; this document is not itself a production approval.

### Verified baseline on `main`

| Capability | Current evidence | Remaining boundary |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL + Prisma foundation | PostgreSQL 17 Compose/CI service, immutable migrations, Prisma schema, RLS/native constraints, migration runbook | Staging cutover rehearsal, backup/restore and managed-database evidence |
| Runtime architecture | pnpm workspace, NestJS/Fastify API, Next.js BFF, strict configuration, RFC 7807 errors, committed deterministic OpenAPI v1 artifact | Generated frontend clients and full domain dependency enforcement |
| Production initialization | No seed path; audited idempotent the superadmin bootstrap; forced password change, verification and MFA | Managed-secret/bootstrap ceremony in staging and automatic credential removal evidence |
| Identity security | HttpOnly BFF cookies, exact-origin mutation enforcement, rotated hashed refresh tokens, family reuse revocation, verification/reset delivery, throttling | Session inventory and broader privileged step-up coverage |
| Booking integrity | Server availability, immutable buffers and policy snapshots, database transition guard, lead/horizon/notice enforcement, local slot intervals, location locks, exclusions, expiring holds, encrypted idempotent replay, emailed tracking verification | Property-based scheduling tests and resource-capacity policy |
| Public UX | Explicit location, real timezone-correct availability, DST overlap labels, hold recovery, nonce confirmation, safe-body verified tracking, differentiated failures | Accessible end-to-end audit and calendar invitations |
| Automated gate | `pnpm quality`, enforced unit coverage, OpenAPI drift/invariant checks, clean PostgreSQL bootstrap/HTTP integration, concurrent booking test, Chromium superadmin/tracking golden paths, two production image builds | Owner E2E, browser axe/visual gates and security/supply-chain scans |
| Git provenance | Reachable history and GitHub contributors limited to `zeldxh` and `lunqdd`; no coauthor trailers | Branch protection, signed release and provenance enforcement |

### Next P0 execution order

1. Accessibility remediation, owner golden path, and automated axe gate for
   critical journeys.
2. Supply-chain hardening: immutable actions/images, CodeQL, dependency and
   container scanning, SBOM, signed provenance, and protected publishing.
3. Infrastructure, staging promotion, backups/PITR, restore evidence,
   OpenTelemetry, SLOs, alerts, and incident runbooks.
4. Privacy workflows, retention policy, final threat model, and the item-by-item
   go-live review.

## Product decision

Citari will migrate from FastAPI, pyodbc, SQL Server, stored procedures, and
runtime demo data to a TypeScript API built with NestJS, Fastify, Prisma, and
PostgreSQL. The existing `/api/v1` contract remains stable during the migration.
PostgreSQL row-level security (RLS), exclusion constraints, and native indexes
will complement Prisma wherever the ORM cannot express a production invariant.

Production contains no seed users or demo businesses. The first superadmin is
created by an audited, idempotent, one-time bootstrap command. It accepts the superadmin and `superadmin@example.com`, reads the initial credential from a secret
manager or protected prompt, requires email verification, MFA enrollment, and a
password change, and never stores the credential in Git, migrations, images, or
logs.

## Release gates

No production release is allowed until all P0 items are complete, cross-tenant
tests and booking-concurrency tests pass against PostgreSQL, a backup restore is
proven, the production migration and rollback are rehearsed in staging, and the
release image is deployed by immutable digest with observable health checks.

## Delivery slices

1. Foundation: ADRs, workspace, PostgreSQL, Prisma schema, RLS, migrations.
2. Identity: secure sessions, bootstrap, MFA, tenant policies, audit trail.
3. Core booking: availability engine, holds, concurrency, public flow.
4. Operations: owner and superadmin workflows, design system, accessibility.
5. Production: CI/CD, security supply chain, observability, backups, runbooks.

Each slice is delivered through a focused branch and pull request. Database
changes use expand/contract migrations; application PRs cannot depend on a
destructive schema change deployed in the same step.
